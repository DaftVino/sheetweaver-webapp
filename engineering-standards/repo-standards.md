# Repository Standards

Canonical reference for how James M. Baker's repositories are organized, named, branched, and documented. Quick-reference one-pagers: [naming](quick-ref-naming.md) · [workflow](quick-ref-workflow.md) · [repo template](quick-ref-repo-template.md).

**Audience:** James M. Baker and any AI agent working in one of these repos. When this document and habit disagree, this document wins. When a repo needs to deviate, record the deviation in an ADR (§6.3) — never deviate silently.

---

## 1. Naming conventions

One rule covers almost everything: **lowercase-kebab-case**. If you are about to name something and it isn't in the exceptions table below, use lowercase-kebab.

| Thing | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Repository | `lowercase-kebab` | `sheetweaver-webapp` |
| Folder | `lowercase-kebab` | `docs/`, `assets/logo/` |
| Doc / config file | `lowercase-kebab.md` | `setup-guide.md`, `provider-notes.md` |
| Source file | Follow the language/platform norm | `Code.js` (Apps Script), `utils.js` |
| Branch | `type/short-slug` | `fix/capture-registry-cap` |
| Git tag | `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` | `v2.0.5` |
| Design doc | `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` | `2026-07-01-fix-registry-cap.md` |
| ADR | `NNNN-slug.md` | `0003-use-properties-service.md` |

**Exceptions — canonical root files only.** UPPERCASE is reserved for the small set of files GitHub and the wider ecosystem treat specially: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`. Nothing else in the repo gets uppercase names — no `ARCHITECTURE.md`, no `Logo/`. Architecture docs are `docs/architecture.md`.

**Slugs:** 2–5 words, hyphenated, no dates in branch names, no issue titles pasted verbatim. Optional but encouraged: prefix branch slug with the issue number (`fix/42-registry-cap`) so the branch is traceable without opening it.

## 2. Required root files

Every repo has these, and only these, at root besides source/config that must live there (e.g. `appsscript.json`, `package.json`):

| File | Purpose | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | What it is, tech stack, install, usage, links into `docs/` | Always |
| `LICENSE` | MIT unless there's a reason otherwise; `Copyright (c) YEAR James M. Baker` (§2.1) | Always |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Keep-a-Changelog format, one entry per released version | Always |
| `.gitignore` | Language/platform appropriate | Always |
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI agent entry point (§7) | Always |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Only if outside contributions are expected | Public-facing repos |
| `SECURITY.md` | Only if the project handles credentials or user data | When applicable |
| `*.example` files | Template for every gitignored local config (`.env.example`, `.clasp.json.example`) | When applicable |

Anything else that reads like documentation goes in `docs/`. A root-level `api-key-setup-readme.md` is a violation — it belongs at `docs/api-key-setup.md`.

### 2.1 Identity and secrets

**Attribution:** LICENSE copyright line is `Copyright (c) YEAR James M. Baker`. Git identity is real-name (`git config --global user.name "James M. Baker"`) with GitHub's noreply email (`git config --global user.email "<user>@users.noreply.github.com"`). Enable both GitHub email privacy settings: *Keep my email addresses private* and *Block command line pushes that expose my email*.

**Secret protection — required in every repo:**

1. **GitHub secret scanning + push protection** — Settings → Code security → enable both. Blocks pushes containing detected credentials server-side.
2. **gitleaks pre-commit hook** — catches secrets locally, before they reach history at all: install gitleaks, then add it via a pre-commit hook (`gitleaks protect --staged`) or the pre-commit framework.
3. **`.example` pattern** — every gitignored config with secrets gets a committed sanitized `*.example` twin. No real key ever appears in a tracked file.

If a secret does land in history: **rotate the credential first** (treat it as burned — scrubbing history is cleanup, not remediation), then rewrite history only if the repo is public.

## 3. Canonical folder structure

Minimal template. Create folders only when there is content for them — empty scaffolding is noise.

```
repo-name/
├── src/                  # Source code (or platform equivalent; Apps Script may keep Code.js at root)
├── tests/                # Test code. Tests are code, never markdown notes.
├── scripts/              # Dev/build/verify tooling (local-verify.js, deploy helpers)
├── assets/               # Images, logos, static media
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture.md   # How the system works (living doc, kept current)
│   ├── designs/          # Fix/feature plans, written BEFORE the work (§6.2)
│   ├── adr/              # Architecture Decision Records (§6.3)
│   └── *.md              # Guides: setup, troubleshooting, runbooks
├── .github/
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/   # bug-report.yml, feature-request.yml
│   ├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
│   └── workflows/        # CI/CD
├── README.md · LICENSE · CHANGELOG.md · CLAUDE.md · .gitignore
```

Rules of thumb:

- `docs/` is flat except for `designs/` and `adr/`. Don't create `docs/bugs/`, `docs/fixes/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/tests/` — each of those has a proper home (§6).
- One concept, one file. A troubleshooting guide and a setup guide are two files, not sections of a mega-doc.
- Media goes in `assets/`, not a capitalized `Logo/` at root.

## 4. Branching and commits (GitHub Flow)

`main` is always releasable. All work happens on short-lived branches off `main`, merged back via PR, branch deleted after merge. No `develop`, no long-lived release branches.

**Branch types:**

| Prefix | Use |
|---|---|
| `feat/` | New functionality |
| `fix/` | Bug fix |
| `docs/` | Documentation only |
| `refactor/` | Code change, no behavior change |
| `chore/` | Tooling, deps, config, CI |
| `test/` | Adding or fixing tests only |

**Commits — Conventional Commits:** `type(scope)?: imperative summary` in lowercase, ≤72 chars, body optional but required when the *why* isn't obvious.

```
fix(sync): cap capture_registry writes at 8KB

PropertiesService silently truncates past 9KB; leave headroom.
Fixes #42
```

Types match branch prefixes plus `perf`, `style`, `ci`. Breaking changes get `!` (`feat!:`) and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

**PRs:** every change to `main` goes through a PR, even solo — the PR is the review checkpoint for AI-generated work and the permanent record of what changed and why. Squash-merge so `main` history stays one-commit-per-change. PR description links its issue (`Fixes #42`) and its design doc if one exists.

## 5. Versioning and releases

- **SemVer:** MAJOR = breaking, MINOR = new features, PATCH = fixes.
- Every released version gets: a `CHANGELOG.md` entry (Keep-a-Changelog: Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed), an annotated git tag `vX.Y.Z`, and a GitHub Release created from that tag (`gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes-from-tag` or paste the changelog section).
- The version displayed in the app must come from one source of truth per repo (a constant or `package.json`), bumped in the release commit: `chore(release): v2.0.6`.
- A changelog entry with no matching tag is a violation — the tag is what makes the version traceable.

## 6. Tracking taxonomy: where things live

The core decision rule:

> **Needs to be tracked and closed?** → GitHub Issue.
> **Explains how you'll build/fix something, before building?** → `docs/designs/`.
> **Records a lasting, hard-to-reverse decision?** → `docs/adr/`.
> **Everything else** → the PR description.

### 6.1 Bugs → GitHub Issues

All bug reports live in GitHub Issues, created from the `bug-report.yml` template (repro steps, expected vs. actual, environment, report ID if applicable). Investigation notes go as **comments on the issue** as you dig — not separate files. Label minimally: `bug`, `enhancement`, `blocked` cover most needs.

The fix is a PR whose description says `Fixes #N`, which closes the issue on merge. AI agents interact via `gh` CLI: `gh issue list`, `gh issue view N`, `gh issue create`, `gh issue comment N`.

### 6.2 Plans → `docs/designs/`

A design doc is a **work plan written before the work**. File: `docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`, from the [design-doc template](templates/design-doc.md). It links the issue(s) it addresses; the PR links back to it.

**When to write one — any of:** the fix spans multiple PRs or systems; it changes persisted data shape (also run the migrate skill); it's risky enough that you want the approach reviewed before code exists; an AI agent will execute it and needs unambiguous instructions. **When not to:** the plan fits in a PR description. Most fixes need no design doc.

Design docs are point-in-time artifacts — they go stale by design and are never updated after implementation (append a one-line `Outcome:` note at most). Lasting knowledge gets promoted to `docs/architecture.md` or an ADR.

### 6.3 Decisions → `docs/adr/`

An ADR records a decision and its rationale so future-you (or an agent) doesn't re-litigate it. File: `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md`, lightweight MADR format ([template](templates/adr.md)): Status / Context / Decision / Consequences, one page max.

Write one when a decision is expensive to reverse, constrains future work, or you've already argued about it twice. Expect 2–5 per repo per year. ADRs are never edited after acceptance — a reversal is a *new* ADR that supersedes the old one (update the old one's Status line only).

### 6.4 What is deliberately NOT a document

- **Fixes** are PRs. There is no `fixes/` folder anywhere.
- **Tests** are code in `tests/`, delivered in the same PR as the fix. A test plan, if ever needed, is a section of the design doc.
- **Task lists / todos** are issues (or checklists inside one issue). Not `todo.md`.

## 7. AI agent integration

Every repo's `CLAUDE.md` (from the [starter template](templates/claude-md-starter.md)) covers: what the project is (2–3 lines), pointers to `docs/architecture.md` and this standards document, repo-specific commands (verify, test, deploy), and repo-specific constraints. It states the standing rules for agents:

1. Bugs and tasks are in GitHub Issues — read them with `gh issue view N` before starting work.
2. Non-trivial work requires a design doc in `docs/designs/` before implementation.
3. Branch, commit, and PR conventions per §4. Never commit directly to `main`.
4. Check `docs/adr/` before proposing architectural changes; a conflicting proposal must supersede the ADR explicitly.

Keep `CLAUDE.md` short (< ~60 lines). It is a router, not a manual — detail lives in `docs/` where humans read it too.

## 8. Migrating existing notes into this system

Existing ad-hoc bug files are usually a **fused artifact**: bug report + investigation notes + partial fix plan in one file. Split them along the §6 seams. Worked example, using a hypothetical `registry-cap-bug.md`:

| Content in the old file | Destination |
|---|---|
| "Captures silently stop saving past ~20 connections" + repro steps | **Issue body** — `gh issue create` from the bug-report template |
| "Dug in: PropertiesService truncates at 9KB, our registry hit 9.1KB" | **Issue comment** — investigation record |
| "Plan: chunk the registry across N properties, migrate existing data" | **Design doc** — `docs/designs/2026-07-01-chunk-capture-registry.md`, links the issue (multi-step + data migration ⇒ earns a design doc) |
| "We should stop using a single shared property for this pattern" | **ADR** — `docs/adr/0004-chunked-property-storage.md`, if you want the rule to outlive this fix |

Then delete the original file. If the fix is small enough that the "plan" is two sentences, skip the design doc — the plan goes in the issue and then the PR description.

Migration checklist per file: (1) create the issue, (2) move investigation to comments, (3) create design doc only if it meets §6.2 criteria, (4) extract any lasting decision to an ADR, (5) delete the source file, (6) do the fix on a `fix/N-slug` branch with `Fixes #N`.

## 9. New repo checklist

1. Name: `lowercase-kebab`, noun-first, no filler (`sheetweaver-webapp`, not `My-SheetWeaver-App`).
2. Create root files (§2) and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml` + PR template from [templates/](templates/). LICENSE copyright: `James M. Baker`.
3. Enable secret scanning + push protection (Settings → Code security) and install the gitleaks pre-commit hook (§2.1).
4. Copy `CLAUDE.md` starter; fill in project summary and commands.
5. Create `docs/` with `architecture.md` stub; add `designs/` and `adr/` when first needed.
6. First ADR (`0001-…`) if the repo embodies a non-obvious platform choice.
7. Branch protection on `main`: require PR (even solo).
8. Tag `v0.1.0` at first working state; start `CHANGELOG.md`.
